# Password Manager (C++)
**My first-year semester project**. This project is a simple password manager designed to securely store and manage passwords. The password manager allows users to store passwords in an encrypted manner and provides access to them through a single master password.

## Features
1. **Password Storage**: The manager allows users to securely store their passwords. Passwords are encrypted and protected by a master password.
2. **Strong Password Generation**: The manager can generate strong, random passwords that are difficult to crack.
3. **Category Management**: Passwords can be organized into different categories for easy management and retrieval.

## Configuration
Before using the password manager for the first time, you need to have your passwords file encrypted and set up the master access password.
1. Run the password manager.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the master access password.

## Usage
After configuring the password manager, you can:
- Display content.
- Search passwords.
- Sort passwords.
- Add password.
- Edit password.
- Delete password.
- Add category.
- Delete category.
